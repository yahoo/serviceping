Contributing to serviceping
============================================
Serviceping development occurs on github at:
https://github.com/yahoo/serviceping

If you want to contribute to serviceping please work on a
fork.  If you do not understand what this means or this process seems
overly complicated feel free to ask questions on the # channel
or in the @yahoo-inc.com mailing list.

General
-------
Running and testing code requires installing serviceping.  It
is recommended to do development against short lived branches.

Testing
-------
Any changes to source code should be tested, both for regression and for
validation of new code.

All tests can be run using the tox tool, install it using the command:

    pip install tox


* Check for [pep8] conformance by running `tox -e pep8` and correct any issues.
* Check for general python issues with [pylint] or [flake8]
* Working unit tests are required for all code that adds new functionality.

We recommend adding configuring your development forks in Travis CI so you can
ensure your fork will automatically build correctly using the CI pipeline.

CI Pipelines
------------
Any new change branches should build correctly using CI prior to being
submitted for upstream inclusion.  Local changes can be tested by running: `tox`
in the git root directory.

Submitting Code
---------------
To submit your code for inclusion upstream, do the following to ensure your
submission only includes your new changes:

1.  Complete a Yahoo CLA.
2.  Perform a merge from the MASTER branch of the main serviceping repository
    into your fork.  This will ensure your pull request only includes your
    changes and will allow you to deal with any upstream changes that affect
    your code.
3.  Clear up all PEP8 issues before submission.  This will ensure your
    changesets only include code changes and not formatting changes.
4.  Clear up or document exceptions for all PyLint/Flake8 issues.  This will
    ensure the evaluation and review of your code does not have common coding
    errors and decrease the human time to evaluate changes.

Documentation
-------------

Please create documentation in the ``doc/`` folder.

Documentation should all be written in [rst].

Style
-----

* Please attempt to follow [pep8] for all code submitted.  This helps make
code merges smaller and more managable.
* Please also attempt to run [pylint] all code submitted.  This finds many
common coding errors and helps ensure good code quality.
